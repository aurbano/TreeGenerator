TreeGenerator
=============

> 2D trees with JavaScript, just because. Although by tweaking the settings you can get pretty much any kind of drawing.


With the colorful setting on:
![Tree generator](http://static.urbanoalvarez.es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tree3.png)

--------

Generating some trees on a canvas element:

```javascript

$(document).ready(function(){
	var canvas = $('canvas');
	var tree = new TreeGenerator(canvas);
	tree.start();
});

```

Custom options can be passed as a second argument to the tree generator:

```javascript

// Customization options, along with their default values:
loss: 0.03, // Width loss per cycle
minSleep: 10, // Min sleep time (For the animation)
branchLoss: 0.8, // % width maintained for branches
mainLoss: 0.8, // % width maintained after branching
speed: 0.3, // Movement speed
newBranch: 0.8, // Chance of not starting a new branch 
colorful: false, // Use colors for new trees
fastMode: true, // Fast growth mode
fadeOut: true, // Fade slowly to black
fadeAmount: 0.05, // How much per iteration
autoSpawn: true, // Automatically create trees
spawnInterval: 250, // Spawn interval in ms
initialWidth: 10, // Initial branch width
indicateNewBranch: false, // Display a visual indicator when a new branch is born
fitScreen: true // Resize canvas to fit screen

```

Try the dat.gui controls on the demo to find the optimal settings for you.
